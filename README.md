Designed and implemented the AES encryption and decryption algorithm for secure data communication in hardware.
Developed modules for key expansion, substitution bytes (S-box), shift rows, mix columns, and add round key
operations.
Optimized for efficient hardware utilization and high-speed data processing.
Supported 128-bit AES encryption and decryption in compliance with NIST standards.
